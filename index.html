            <p>For my CS junior design project my team and I created a simple service monitor for Redox OS. Redox is a new microkernel operating system written in Rust. I learned Rust for this project and thoroughly enjoyed learning the new system to try and build out some important features. With some guidance from our proffessors and the Redox community we created a nice proof of concept with a CLI and GUI in libcosmic. Watch the video below if you'd like to know more.</p>

            <p>Have you ever wanted to relive learning to drive stick? Me neither, but I wanted to try building a driving sim specifically designed to be played with a keyboard in the Godot engine. I thought it would be a good idea to use Vim's right hand key bindings to move the shifter. I was able to get a prototype working (video below) but the controls can be difficult and I spent a lot of time tweaking the gearing system to no avail. The "drivetrain" code would likely need a complete overhaul which I may come back to but I have other ideas from this project I want to revisit first. You can find the Godot project on github <a

                up with an innovation that would solve a problem in our community. Me and my good friends Scarlett
                Ramu
                and Erick Lopez teamed up to create a single computer that would power two separate windows
                computers.
                Our
                project went really well and at both of the innovation expos we had many teachers, students, and
                parents

                and
                it revolved around evolution which is what we where learning in biology at the time. The idea was
                that
                we
                would all build the same robot and then compete with them. after the competitions we would add
                upgrades
                and switch up the design to adapt to the environment and our competitors but we would not know what
                changes that the teachers would make to the arena. My group made a robot we called "BloodBot9000",

              <p>To start off this project we had to come up with 3 possible reactions to power our car. I chose
                calcium
                carbonate and hydrochloric acid and vinegar + baking soda as a backup, but i really really wanted to
                do
                a
                DIY battery made from coke, copper and zinc. I really wanted to do the coke battery to experiment
                with
                electrolysis because the chemistry of batteries and how they worked really interested me and so we
                ruled
                out the other two unless we really had to do them. These reactions and the battery especially raised
                a
                few
                questions. How much voltage/current can this battery produce? What kind of motors are we using and
                can
                they produce enough torque to propel whatever chassis we use? What should we make the chassis out
                of?
                How
                big should the wheels be? Will we have to use gears to transfer the energy from the motors to the
                axles?
                Does it have to be aerodynamic? </p>
              <h3>Planning</h3>
              <p>To follow up with these questions I did some research on the mechanics of car/vehicle design. I
                found
                that aerodynamics could drastically improve our speed and efficiency but in the long run we did not
                have
                time to implement an aerodynamic shell like we brainstormed. Another thing that ended up applying
                much
                more than I thought would was an article about re-assembling a vintage car, in the article they
                discussed
                some of the sourcing for the parts and how hard it was. When we were trying to get parts like
                bearings
                we
                couldn't because we thought that the school would be able to provide us with supplies but a lot of
                the
                stuff we needed, like bearings, was out of stock.</p>

              <h3>Design, Create, & Evaluate</h3>
              <p>Here is sketch idea that I had for our Chem-E-car. The circles on the chassis are where the cells
                of my
                battery are and you can see some of the measurements and markings that me and my group put together
                so
                that it would be easier for us to make a 3d model of it. We used this design because it could hold
                up to
                5
                cells if necessary and could fit the motors, wheels and axles without any trouble.</p>

              <p>This is the inventor drawing for the first prototype that my group came up with, as you can see it
                greatly resembles the paper sketch that we did.</p>
              <img src="images/Inventor1.png" width="500" alt="Image" style="margin-left: 33vw;" class="img-fluid">
              <p>Here is the second design that me and my group created. At this point we realized that our super
                cool
                coke battery wasn't producing any current and we had to scrap it so we strapped some AA batteries on
                and
                stripped away a large amount of the chassis as well as changing the material to plastic.</p>
              <img src="images/inventor2.png" width="500" alt="Image" style="margin-left: 33vw;" class="img-fluid">
              <p>Here is a car design that Joseph and I collaborated on after school as a little experiment, it is
                very
                simple with some AA batteries and a propeller but it managed to go all the way down A hall with no
                hitches
                so I'd call it a success. We did this because both of us created batteries that produced a voltage
                but
                had
                too high of a resistance for the current to flow.</p>

                <p>Our final product was much better despite only having a range of about a meter. The final product
                  was
                  much more consistent and we were able to more accurately calculate where the football would be at
                  any
                  given point. below is a video of our final product.</p>

              <h3>Investigate 10/10/19</h3>
              <p>Our Challenge was that we had to build a device to launch a small foam footballs at least 2 meters
                consistently, it had to fit in a 50x50cm cube, and we couldn't use kits or pneumatic launching or a
                slingshot and it had to have a launching arm which limited us to making a catapult or some variation
                of
                a
                catapult, like a trebuchet. We started our investigation with a mind map sort of thing where we
                wrote
                out
                ideas to solve the problem of getting a small football across the room. We would also have to
                complete
                tables and graphs that described our vertical and horizontal velocity, acceleration, and position.

              <h3>Plan 10/10/19</h3>
                <img src="images/cat1.jpg" width="500" alt="Image" style="margin-left: 33vw;" class="img-fluid">
              <p>Once we found out it had to have a fulcrum arm we decided we'd try to get around this by putting a
                football launcher that uses vex wheels at the end of the arm however we quickly realized that the
                fact
                we
                were placed in a group where neither of us had the cSTEM advisement and we both had busy schedules
                that
                disallowed us from working on the catapult after school. So we decided to go for a pretty basic,
                bare
                bones setup that we could feasibly create with the little time we had. This would also make our math
                a
                little bit easier to do as we could very easily measure our theta and initial height.</p>
              <h3>Design 10/10/19</h3>
                <img src="images/cat2.jpg" width="500" alt="Image" style="margin-left: 33vw;" class="img-fluid">
              <p>Since neither of us had the cSTEM advisement we had little time to build let alone design the
                catapult.
                however when we did have a chance to design we drew out something that we thought would work well
                and we
                could complete in a reasonable amount of time. The drawing is very basic, it only has the launching
                arm,
                a
                base, and some rubber bands to power it.</p>

              <h3>Create 10/12/19</h3>
              <p>The creation of our first prototype was relatively quick and easy reflecting the basic design we
                created.
                You might initially think this as a relatively bad thing but it was exactly what we needed due to
                our
                extreme time constraint. We were able to finish our first prototype in about an hour after school in
                the
                engineering room.below is one of the videos of what we made that day</p>

              <h3>Evaluate - Test 10/18/19 & 10/24/19</h3>
              <p>Our first test went horrible to be frank, our rubber bands didn't have enough tension to actually
                pull
                the launching arm around the fulcrum to launch the ball so we took turns powering the catapult. Not
                only
                did our design barley work at all, it was extremely inconsistent but we averaged about 1.4 seconds
                in
                the
                air and about a 2.7 meter range. but the minimum distance we got was .3 meters and the max was 6 so
                we
                really needed to fix some things.</p>
