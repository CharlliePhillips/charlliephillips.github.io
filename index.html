          <p>
            For my CS junior design project my team and I created a simple service monitor for Redox OS. Redox is a new microkernel operating system written in Rust. I learned Rust for this project and thoroughly enjoyed learning the new system to try and build out some important features. With some guidance from our proffessors and the Redox community we created a nice proof of concept with a CLI and GUI in libcosmic. Watch the video below if you'd like to know more.

          <p>This is a simulation of being a gatech student for the GBA. I made for CS2110 Spring 2024 with Mr. Mark Moss.
              The game was written in C and the graphics where made in GIMP. It is a simple game where you try to doge the same hazards that GT students have to on a day to day in current year. The ROM can be downloaded <a

          <p>Have you ever wanted to relive learning to drive stick? Me neither, but I wanted to try building a driving sim specifically designed to be played with a keyboard in the Godot engine. I thought it would be a good idea to use Vim's right hand key bindings to move the shifter. I was able to get a prototype working (video below) but the controls can be difficult and I spent a lot of time tweaking the gearing system to no avail. The "drivetrain" code would likely need a complete overhaul which I may come back to but I have other ideas from this project I want to revisit first. You can find the Godot project on github <a

          <h3 class="section-title">Think Global Act Local</h3>
          <p>
            First semester of the 2018-2019 year we started the "Think Global Act Local" project where we had
            to
            come
            up with an innovation that would solve a problem in our community. Me and my good friends Scarlett
            Ramu
            and Erick Lopez teamed up to create a single computer that would power two separate windows
            computers.
            Our
            project went really well and at both of the innovation expos we had many teachers, students, and
            parents
            who were interested in our prototype and its potential applications.

          <h3 class="section-title">The Most Dangerous Game</h3>
          <p>At the beginning of 2018 my fellow freshman and I started a project based on the VEX robotics
            system,
            and
            it revolved around evolution which is what we where learning in biology at the time. The idea was
            that
            we
            would all build the same robot and then compete with them. after the competitions we would add
            upgrades
            and switch up the design to adapt to the environment and our competitors but we would not know what
            changes that the teachers would make to the arena. My group made a robot we called "BloodBot9000",
            below
            is a video I put together of the robot.</p>

          <h4 class="section-title">Chem-E-Car</h4>
          <h4>Investigation</h4>
          <p>To start off this project we had to come up with 3 possible reactions to power our car. I chose
            calcium
            carbonate and hydrochloric acid and vinegar + baking soda as a backup, but i really really wanted to
            do
            a
            DIY battery made from coke, copper and zinc. I really wanted to do the coke battery to experiment
            with
            electrolysis because the chemistry of batteries and how they worked really interested me and so we
            ruled
            out the other two unless we really had to do them. These reactions and the battery especially raised
            a
            few
            questions. How much voltage/current can this battery produce? What kind of motors are we using and
            can
            they produce enough torque to propel whatever chassis we use? What should we make the chassis out
            of?
            How
            big should the wheels be? Will we have to use gears to transfer the energy from the motors to the
            axles?
            Does it have to be aerodynamic? </p>
          <h4>Planning</h4>
          <p>To follow up with these questions I did some research on the mechanics of car/vehicle design. I
            found
            that aerodynamics could drastically improve our speed and efficiency but in the long run we did not
            have
            time to implement an aerodynamic shell like we brainstormed. Another thing that ended up applying
            much
            more than I thought would was an article about re-assembling a vintage car, in the article they
            discussed
            some of the sourcing for the parts and how hard it was. When we were trying to get parts like
            bearings
            we
            couldn't because we thought that the school would be able to provide us with supplies but a lot of
            the
            stuff we needed, like bearings, was out of stock.</p>
          <h4>Design, Create, & Evaluate</h4>
          <p>Here is sketch idea that I had for our Chem-E-car. The circles on the chassis are where the cells
            of my
            battery are and you can see some of the measurements and markings that me and my group put together
            so
            that it would be easier for us to make a 3d model of it. We used this design because it could hold
            up to
            5
            cells if necessary and could fit the motors, wheels and axles without any trouble.</p>

            This is the inventor drawing for the first prototype that my group came up with, as you can see it greatly resembles the paper sketch that we did.

          <p>Here is the second design that me and my group created. At this point we realized that our super
            cool
            coke battery wasn't producing any current and we had to scrap it so we strapped some AA batteries on
            and
            stripped away a large amount of the chassis as well as changing the material to plastic.</p>

          <p>Here is a car design that Joseph and I collaborated on after school as a little experiment, it is
            very
            simple with some AA batteries and a propeller but it managed to go all the way down A hall with no
            hitches
            so I'd call it a success. We did this because both of us created batteries that produced a voltage
            but
            had
            too high of a resistance for the current to flow.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Catapult Project</h2>

          <h3>Investigate 10/10/19</h3>
          <p>Our Challenge was that we had to build a device to launch a small foam footballs at least 2 meters
            consistently, it had to fit in a 50x50cm cube, and we couldn't use kits or pneumatic launching or a
            slingshot and it had to have a launching arm which limited us to making a catapult or some variation
            of
            a
            catapult, like a trebuchet. We started our investigation with a mind map sort of thing where we
            wrote
            out
            ideas to solve the problem of getting a small football across the room. We would also have to
            complete
            tables and graphs that described our vertical and horizontal velocity, acceleration, and position.
            Scroll
            down for the related graph and tables</p>
          <h3>Plan 10/10/19</h3>

            <img src="images/cat1.jpg" width="500" alt="Image"  class="img-fluid">
          </div>
          <p>Once we found out it had to have a fulcrum arm we decided we'd try to get around this by putting a
            football launcher that uses vex wheels at the end of the arm however we quickly realized that the
            fact
            we
            were placed in a group where neither of us had the cSTEM advisement and we both had busy schedules
            that
            disallowed us from working on the catapult after school. So we decided to go for a pretty basic,
            bare
            bones setup that we could feasibly create with the little time we had. This would also make our math
            a
            little bit easier to do as we could very easily measure our theta and initial height.</p>
          <h3>Design 10/10/19</h3>
          <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/cat2.jpg" alt="Image">
          </div>
          <p>Since neither of us had the cSTEM advisement we had little time to build let alone design the
            catapult.
            however when we did have a chance to design we drew out something that we thought would work well
            and we
            could complete in a reasonable amount of time. The drawing is very basic, it only has the launching
            arm,
            a
            base, and some rubber bands to power it.</p>

          <p>The creation of our first prototype was relatively quick and easy reflecting the basic design we
            created.
            You might initially think this as a relatively bad thing but it was exactly what we needed due to
            our
            extreme time constraint. We were able to finish our first prototype in about an hour after school in
            the
            engineering room.below is one of the videos of what we made that day</p>
          <h3>Evaluate - Test 10/18/19 & 10/24/19</h3>
          <p>Our first test went horrible to be frank, our rubber bands didn't have enough tension to actually
            pull
            the launching arm around the fulcrum to launch the ball so we took turns powering the catapult. Not
            only
            did our design barley work at all, it was extremely inconsistent but we averaged about 1.4 seconds
            in
            the
            air and about a 2.7 meter range. but the minimum distance we got was .3 meters and the max was 6 so
            we
            really needed to fix some things.</p>

          <h3>Final Product</h3>
          <p>
            Our final product was much better despite only having a range of about a meter. The final product was much more consistent and we were able to more accurately calculate where the football would be at any given point. below is a video of our final product.
